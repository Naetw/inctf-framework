# Dashboard

The dashboard is the website that runs the CTF. It lets users log in, discover the
active services, check the services' status and submit flags, check out the rankings
:).


## Structure

The dashboard is designed to withstand a heavy load (hackers are F5-machines),
without overloading the rest of the CTF infrastructure. This is why the web server,
```web.py```, is short and nible, and exclusively talks to a Redis cache. The cache
is populated by ```worker.py```, which fetches updates from the central database
every second.

You can start everything as a service (```start dashboard```), or manually with
```honcho start```.

## API

All the data shown on the website pages is pulled from a JSON API, so that hackers can easily use it in scripts.
Itâ€™s as simple as
```
curl -u <TEAM_NAME>:<PASSWORD>  http://<DOMAIN>/scores
```

### Endpoints

* ```/services```: list the services names, their description, and the flag ids.
* ```/services_status```: shows if services are up or down
* ```/scores```: gives the current rankings
* ```/flag```: use this to submit a stolen flag. POST a ```{flag: <FLAG>}``` JSON hash
* ```/exploitlogs```: Get log output of last run of exploits. For successful runs, no
                      logs are returned.
* ```/updatedcontainers```: List of service and exploit containers which will be
                            synchronized at start of next round.
